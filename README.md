# RT-Analysis
RT-Analysis a small CLI program written in C++ that performs hard real-time schedulability tests.
It is written to double check exercises results for my RTOS course.

Roadmap:
  - [] implement exception mechanism for error handling;
  - [] implement resource aware task set scheduling;
